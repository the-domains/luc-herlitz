            <title><![CDATA[I love my job!]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>I love my job!</h1><p>In April, I started working for Planning Center. This has been the best career move I’ve ever made. I’ve been a long-time Planning Center fanboy since it became a thing ten years ago. In fact, I almost started working there nine years ago. I had a few interviews with Jeff and for one reason or another, I turned him down. It’s not often you get a chance to correct a major mistake like that, but I’m glad I got the chance!</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a98b7c1f-cacf-4993-b228-3eb4393e9af6.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How I train my worship team</h1><p>"Musicians showing up to rehearsal unprepared is a constant battle of mine." This is something we hear all the time from worship leaders. Imagine if Sunday morning downbeat happened without a hitch and your band hit every part? With Worship Online, not only is that possible, but it's easier than ever.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0316db93b7d18c025174a7283d35cea8b3734070.png"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Keybase]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Keybase</h1><p>I’ve always been a fan of security and encryption. Keybase is looking to make encryption easier for the “regular, everyday person” to use. In addition, they’ve come up with a brilliant online storage option that can sign your files, encrypt them, or create a shared folder and encrypt it for select recipients. Even if you don’t know their encryption information, you can put in something like their Twitter handle. It’s in alpha stage right now, but the results are looking great.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4e1be2b03b11868fccea0bf7b19a84a3477822ee.jpg"></article>]]></description>
