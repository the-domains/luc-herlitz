  files, encrypt them, or create a shared folder and encrypt it for select
  recipients. Even if you don’t know their encryption information, you can put
  in something like their Twitter handle. It’s in alpha stage right now, but the
  results are looking great.

# Keybase

I've always been a fan of security and encryption. Keybase is looking to make encryption easier for the _"regular, everyday person"_ to use. In addition, they've come up with a brilliant online storage option that can sign your files, encrypt them, or create a shared folder and encrypt it for select recipients. Even if you don't know their encryption information, you can put in something like their Twitter handle. It's in alpha stage right now, but the results are looking great.

I have some invite codes if something like this sounds appealing to you.
