  In April, I started working for Planning Center. This has been the best career
  move I’ve ever made. I’ve been a long-time Planning Center fanboy since it
  became a thing ten years ago. In fact, I almost started working there nine
  years ago. I had a few interviews with Jeff and for one reason or another, I
  turned him down. It’s not often you get a chance to correct a major mistake
  like that, but I’m glad I got the chance!

# I love my job!

In April, I started working for Planning Center. This has been the best career move I've ever made. I've been a long-time Planning Center fanboy since it became a thing ten years ago. In fact, I almost started working there nine years ago. I had a few interviews with Jeff and for one reason or another, I turned him down. It's not often you get a chance to correct a major mistake like that, but I'm glad I got the chance!
