  This is something we hear all the time from worship leaders. Imagine if Sunday
  morning downbeat happened without a hitch and your band hit every part? With
  Worship Online, not only is that possible, but it's easier than ever.

# How I train my worship team

I don't. As a volunteer worship leader, I don't have the luxury of spending long hours planning rehearsals and recording video and audio files. Then I found WorshipOnline.com! I've been using [Planning Center Services][0] for nearly a decade to organize my worship teams, but getting them training is a whole different thing.

This service provides videos of the various guitar, bass, and vocal parts, often times including lessons in addition to the performance video. This newly discovered gem is one that I can't live without!
